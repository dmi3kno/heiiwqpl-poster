  abstract = {Two efficient algorithms for enclosing a zero of a continuous function are presented. They are similar to the recent methods, but together with quadratic interpolation they make essential use of inverse cubic interpolation as well. Since asymptotically the inverse cubic interpolation is always chosen by the algorithms, they achieve higher-efficiency indices: 1.6529\ldots{} for the first algorithm, and 1.6686\ldots{} for the second one. It is proved that the second algorithm is optimal in a certain family. Numerical experiments show that the two new methods compare well with recent methods, as well as with the efficient solvers of Dekker, Brent, Bus and Dekker, and Le. The second method from the present article has the best behavior of all 12 methods especially when the termination tolerance is small.},

  abstract = {Bayesian data analysis (BDA) is a powerful tool for making inference from ecological data, but its full potential has yet to be realized. Despite a generally positive trajectory in research surrounding model development and assessment, far too little attention has been given to prior specification. Default priors, a sub-class of non-informative prior distributions that are often chosen without critical thought or evaluation, are commonly used in practice. We believe the fear of being too `subjective' has prevented many researchers from using any prior information in their analyses despite the fact that defending prior choice (informative or not) promotes good statistical practice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of how BDA is currently being used in a random sample of articles, discuss implications for inference if current bad practices continue, and highlight sub-fields where knowledge about the system has improved inference and promoted good statistical practices through the careful and justified use of informative priors. We hope to inspire a renewed discussion about the use of Bayesian priors in Ecology with particular attention paid to specification and justification. We also emphasize that all priors are the result of a subjective choice, and should be discussed in that way.},

  abstract = {Ordinal predictors are commonly used in regression models. They are often incorrectly treated as either nominal or metric, thus under- or overestimating the information contained. Such practices may lead to worse inference and predictions compared to methods which are specifically designed for this purpose. We propose a new method for modelling ordinal predictors that applies in situations in which it is reasonable to assume their effects to be monotonic. The parameterization of such monotonic effects is realized in terms of a scale parameter b representing the direction and size of the effect and a simplex parameter modelling the normalized differences between categories. This ensures that predictions increase or decrease monotonically, while changes between adjacent categories may vary across categories. This formulation generalizes to interaction terms as well as multilevel structures. Monotonic effects may be applied not only to ordinal predictors, but also to other discrete variables for which a monotonic relationship is plausible. In simulation studies we show that the model is well calibrated and, if there is monotonicity present, exhibits predictive performance similar to or even better than other approaches designed to handle ordinal predictors. Using Stan, we developed a Bayesian estimation method for monotonic effects which allows us to incorporate prior information and to check the assumption of monotonicity. We have implemented this method in the R package brms, so that fitting monotonic effects in a fully Bayesian framework is now straightforward.},

We consider bivariate and time series extensions of the g-and-k distribution under this framework, and develop an efficient component-wise updating scheme free of likelihood functions to be used within the SMC algorithm. In addition, we trial the set of octiles as summary statistics as well as functions of these that form robust measures of location, scale, skewness and kurtosis. We show that these modifications lead to reasonably precise inferences that are more closely comparable to computationally intensive likelihood-based inference.

We first introduce a method of eliciting univariate beta distributions for the probability of each category, conditional on the probabilities of other categories. Two different forms of multivariate prior are derived from the elicited beta distributions. First, we determine the hyperparameters of a Dirichlet distribution by reconciling the assessed parameters of the univariate beta conditional distributions. Although the Dirichlet distribution is the standard conjugate prior distribution for multinomial models, it is not flexible enough to represent a broad range of prior information. Second, we use the beta distributions to determine the parameters of a Connor\textendash Mosimann distribution, which is a generalization of a Dirichlet distribution and is also a conjugate prior for multinomial models. It has a larger number of parameters than the standard Dirichlet distribution and hence a more flexible structure. The elicitation methods are designed to be used with the aid of interactive graphical user-friendly software.},

However, specifying suitable priors is often difficult even when detailed prior knowledge is available in principle. The challenge is to express quantitative information in the form of a probability distribution. Prior elicitation addresses this question by extracting subjective information from an expert and transforming it into a valid prior. Most existing methods, however, require information to be provided on the unobservable parameters, whose effect on the data generating process is often complicated and hard to understand. We propose an alternative approach that only requires knowledge about the observable outcomes -- knowledge which is often much easier for experts to provide. Building upon a principled statistical framework, our approach utilizes the prior predictive distribution implied by the model to automatically transform experts judgements about plausible outcome values to suitable priors on the parameters. We also provide computational strategies to perform inference and guidelines to facilitate practical use.},

In many such cases, the nature of the uncertainty is more naturally characterized by quantiles than by parameters of familiar continuous probability distributions. In the practice of decision analysis, it is common to fit a hand-drawn curve to quantile outputs from probability elicitations on a continuous uncertain quantity and to then discretize the curve. The resulting discrete probability distribution is an approximation that cuts off the distribution's tails and eliminates intermediate values. Quantile-parameterized distributions address this problem by using quantiles themselves to parameterize a continuous probability distribution. We define quantile-parameterized distributions, illustrate their flexibility and range of applicability, and conclude with practical considerations when parameterizing distributions using inconsistent quantile assessments.},

The system is comprised of unbounded, semibounded, and bounded distributions, each of which offers nearly unlimited shape flexibility compared to previous systems of distributions. Explicit shape-flexibility comparisons are provided. Unlike other distributions that require nonlinear optimization for parameter estimation, the metalog quantile functions and probability density functions have simple closed-form expressions that are quantile parameterized linearly by cumulative-distribution-function data. Applications in fish biology and hydrology show how metalogs may aid data and distribution research by imposing fewer shape constraints than other commonly used distributions. Applications in decision analysis show how the metalog system can be specified with three assessed quantiles, how it facilities Monte Carlo simulation, and how applying it aided an actual decision that would have been made wrongly based on commonly used discrete methods.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

Prior elicitation transforms domain knowledge of various kinds into well-defined prior distributions, and offers a solution to the prior specification problem, in principle. In practice, however, we are still fairly far from having usable prior elicitation tools that could significantly influence the way we build probabilistic models in academia and industry. We lack elicitation methods that integrate well into the Bayesian workflow and perform elicitation efficiently in terms of costs of time and effort. We even lack a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding different facets of the prior elicitation problem. Why are we not widely using prior elicitation? We analyze the state of the art by identifying a range of key aspects of prior knowledge elicitation, from properties of the modelling task and the nature of the priors to the form of interaction with the expert. The existing prior elicitation literature is reviewed and categorized in these terms. This allows recognizing under-studied directions in prior elicitation research, finally leading to a proposal of several new avenues to improve prior elicitation methodology.},

Although it may be tempting to view expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.},

  abstract = {We investigate an isotonic parameterization for monotone polynomials previously unconsidered in the statistical literature. We show that this parameterization is more flexible than its alternatives through enabling polynomials to be constrained to be monotone over either a compact interval or a semi-compact interval of the form [a,{$\infty$}), in addition to over the whole real line. Furthermore, algorithms based on our new parameterization estimate the fitted monotone polynomials much faster than algorithms based on previous isotonic parameterizations which in turn makes the use of standard bootstrap methodology feasible. We investigate the use of the bootstrap under monotonicity constraints to obtain confidence bands for the fitted curves and show that an adjustment by using either the `m out of n' bootstrap or a post hoc symmetrization of the confidence bands is necessary to achieve more uniform coverage probabilities. We illustrate our new methodology with two real world examples which demonstrate not only the need for such techniques, but how restricting the monotonicity constraints to be over either a compact or semi-compact interval allows the fitting of even degree monotone polynomials. We also describe methods for using the `m out of n' bootstrap to select the degree of the fitted monotone polynomial. All algorithms discussed in this paper are available in the R package MonoPoly (version 0.3-6 or later).},

  abstract = {Expert opinion and judgment enter into the practice of statistical inference and decision-making in numerous ways. Indeed, there is essentially no aspect of scientific investigation in which judgment is not required. Judgment is necessarily subjective, but should be made as carefully, as objectively, and as scientifically as possible.Elicitation of expert knowledge concerning an uncertain quantity expresses that knowledge in the form of a (subjective) probability distribution for the quantity. Such distributions play an important role in statistical inference (for example as prior distributions in a Bayesian analysis) and in evidence-based decision-making (for example as expressions of uncertainty regarding inputs to a decision model). This article sets out a number of practices through which elicitation can be made as rigorous and scientific as possible.One such practice is to follow a recognized protocol that is designed to address and minimize the cognitive biases that experts are prone to when making probabilistic judgments. We review the leading protocols in the field, and contrast their different approaches to dealing with these biases through the medium of a detailed case study employing the SHELF protocol.The article ends with discussion of how to elicit a joint probability distribution for multiple uncertain quantities, which is a challenge for all the leading protocols. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Quantile-parameterized distributions are characterized by high shape flexibility and interpretability of its parameters, and are therefore useful for elicitation on observables. To encode uncertainty in the quantiles elicited from experts, we propose a Bayesian model based on the metalog distribution and a version of the Dirichlet prior. The resulting ``hybrid'' expert elicitation protocol for characterizing uncertainty in parameters using questions about the observable quantities is discussed and contrasted to parametric and predictive elicitation.},

We describe the method of *indirect likelihood* to be used in the Bayesian models with sampling distributions which lack an explicit cumulative distribution function. We provide examples and demonstrate the equivalence of the "quantile-based" (indirect) likelihood to the conventional "density-defined" (direct) likelihood. We consider practical aspects of the numerical inversion of quantile function by root-finding required by the indirect likelihood method. In particular, we consider a problem of ensuring the validity of an arbitrary quantile function with the help of Chebyshev polynomials and provide useful tips and implementation of these algorithms in Stan and R. We also extend the same method to propose the definition of an *indirect prior* and discuss the situations where it can be useful},

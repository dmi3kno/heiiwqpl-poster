  abstract = {Probability elicitation is an important area of research with a wide scope for investigation and experimentation. The existing literature on the subject is vast and spread over many disciplines. This indicates the importance of the subject and the ubiquitous nature of the concept of probability. In this thesis, we focus on a probability elicitation method known as predictive elicitation. Predictive elicitation is a method for estimating hyperparameters of prior distributions by inverting corresponding prior predictive distributions. The uncertainty associated with prior predictive distributions is the uncertainty associated with socalled observable quantities. This uncertainty is generally accepted to be fundamentally more robust for elicitation than the uncertainty about unobservable parameters associated with prior distributions. Although predictive elicitation is the most natural way for eliciting probabilities for Bayesian models, it has two major difficulties for practical implementation. The first of these difficulties is related to inverting integral equations. Here, we deal with this difficulty by restricting the space of possible classes of prior distributions into three families, namely the beta, gamma and normal families as suggested by Percy (2002- 2004). The second difficulty is the problem of constraints on eliciting quantiles of the prior predictive distribution. In this thesis, we propose a method for identifying such constraints for single parameter models. We also propose a computational algorithm that makes predictive elicitation accessible for two-parameter models. We demonstrate that using the proposed elicitation method for two-parameter models it is possible to identify associated constraints. In summary, we extend the current literature related to predictive elicitation by adding to it the following main points: We propose a method for identifying constraints on the elicitation of quantiles for single parameter models. We propose the use of a new hybrid elicitation procedure for two-parameter models. We also investigate a method for identifying constraints on the elicitation process posed by the hybrid elicitation strategy. We provide numerical algorithms, programmed using MathCAD software, that enable full implementation of predictive elicitation for single parameter models. We also provide similar programs for selected two-parameter models that enable implementation of the proposed hybrid elicitation method. These algorithms can be used as bases for developing generic software for implementing predictive elicitation. Further research is needed to address the issue of the practical applicability of predictive elicitation to multi-parameter and multivariate models. The advancements made in this thesis provide foundations and an approach for dealing with the problem of constraints that can be extended to solve similar problems for multi-parameter and multivariate models.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the task of eliciting an informative prior distribution for multinomial models. We first introduce a method of eliciting univariate beta distributions for the probability of each category, conditional on the probabilities of other categories. Two different forms of multivariate prior are derived from the elicited beta distributions. First, we determine the hyperparameters of a Dirichlet distribution by reconciling the assessed parameters of the univariate beta conditional distributions. Although the Dirichlet distribution is the standard conjugate prior distribution for multinomial models, it is not flexible enough to represent a broad range of prior information. Second, we use the beta distributions to determine the parameters of a Connor\textendash Mosimann distribution, which is a generalization of a Dirichlet distribution and is also a conjugate prior for multinomial models. It has a larger number of parameters than the standard Dirichlet distribution and hence a more flexible structure. The elicitation methods are designed to be used with the aid of interactive graphical user-friendly software.},

  abstract = {Elicitation is a key task for subjectivist Bayesians. Although skeptics hold that elicitation cannot (or perhaps should not) be done, in practice it brings statisticians closer to their clients and subject-matter expert colleagues. This article reviews the state of the art, reflecting the experience of statisticians informed by the fruits of a long line of psychological research into how people represent uncertain information cognitively and how they respond to questions about that information. In a discussion of the elicitation process, the first issue to address is what it means for an elicitation to be successful; that is, what criteria should be used. Our answer is that a successful elicitation faithfully represents the opinion of the person being elicited. It is not necessarily ``true'' in some objectivistic sense, and cannot be judged in that way. We see that elicitation as simply part of the process of statistical modeling. Indeed, in a hierarchical model at which point the likelihood ends and the prior begins is ambiguous. Thus the same kinds of judgment that inform statistical modeling in general also inform elicitation of prior distributions. The psychological literature suggests that people are prone to certain heuristics and biases in how they respond to situations involving uncertainty. As a result, some of the ways of asking questions about uncertain quantities are preferable to others, and appear to be more reliable. However, data are lacking on exactly how well the various methods work, because it is unclear, other than by asking using an elicitation method, just what the person believes. Consequently, one is reduced to indirect means of assessing elicitation methods. The tool chest of methods is growing. Historically, the first methods involved choosing hyperparameters using conjugate prior families, at a time when these were the only families for which posterior distributions could be computed. Modern computational methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, have freed elicitation from this constraint. As a result, now both parametric and nonparametric methods are available for low-dimensional problems. High-dimensional problems are probably best thought of as lacking another hierarchical level, which has the effect of reducing the as-yet-unelicited parameter space. Special considerations apply to the elicitation of group opinions. Informal methods, such as Delphi, encourage the participants to discuss the issue in the hope of reaching consensus. Formal methods, such as weighted averages or logarithmic opinion pools, each have mathematical characteristics that are uncomfortable. Finally, there is the question of what a group opinion even means, because it is not necessarily the opinion of any participant.},

  abstract = {The prior distribution for the unknown model parameters plays a crucial role in the process of statistical inference based on Bayesian methods. However, specifying suitable priors is often difficult even when detailed prior knowledge is available in principle. The challenge is to express quantitative information in the form of a probability distribution. Prior elicitation addresses this question by extracting subjective information from an expert and transforming it into a valid prior. Most existing methods, however, require information to be provided on the unobservable parameters, whose effect on the data generating process is often complicated and hard to understand. We propose an alternative approach that only requires knowledge about the observable outcomes -- knowledge which is often much easier for experts to provide. Building upon a principled statistical framework, our approach utilizes the prior predictive distribution implied by the model to automatically transform experts judgements about plausible outcome values to suitable priors on the parameters. We also provide computational strategies to perform inference and guidelines to facilitate practical use.},

In many such cases, the nature of the uncertainty is more naturally characterized by quantiles than by parameters of familiar continuous probability distributions. In the practice of decision analysis, it is common to fit a hand-drawn curve to quantile outputs from probability elicitations on a continuous uncertain quantity and to then discretize the curve. The resulting discrete probability distribution is an approximation that cuts off the distribution's tails and eliminates intermediate values. Quantile-parameterized distributions address this problem by using quantiles themselves to parameterize a continuous probability distribution. We define quantile-parameterized distributions, illustrate their flexibility and range of applicability, and conclude with practical considerations when parameterizing distributions using inconsistent quantile assessments.},

The system is comprised of unbounded, semibounded, and bounded distributions, each of which offers nearly unlimited shape flexibility compared to previous systems of distributions. Explicit shape-flexibility comparisons are provided. Unlike other distributions that require nonlinear optimization for parameter estimation, the metalog quantile functions and probability density functions have simple closed-form expressions that are quantile parameterized linearly by cumulative-distribution-function data. Applications in fish biology and hydrology show how metalogs may aid data and distribution research by imposing fewer shape constraints than other commonly used distributions. Applications in decision analysis show how the metalog system can be specified with three assessed quantiles, how it facilities Monte Carlo simulation, and how applying it aided an actual decision that would have been made wrongly based on commonly used discrete methods.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

  abstract = {Expert opinion and judgment enter into the practice of statistical inference and decision-making in numerous ways. Indeed, there is essentially no aspect of scientific investigation in which judgment is not required. Judgment is necessarily subjective, but should be made as carefully, as objectively, and as scientifically as possible.Elicitation of expert knowledge concerning an uncertain quantity expresses that knowledge in the form of a (subjective) probability distribution for the quantity. Such distributions play an important role in statistical inference (for example as prior distributions in a Bayesian analysis) and in evidence-based decision-making (for example as expressions of uncertainty regarding inputs to a decision model). This article sets out a number of practices through which elicitation can be made as rigorous and scientific as possible.One such practice is to follow a recognized protocol that is designed to address and minimize the cognitive biases that experts are prone to when making probabilistic judgments. We review the leading protocols in the field, and contrast their different approaches to dealing with these biases through the medium of a detailed case study employing the SHELF protocol.The article ends with discussion of how to elicit a joint probability distribution for multiple uncertain quantities, which is a challenge for all the leading protocols.
